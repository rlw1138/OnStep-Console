# OnStep-Console
A python control console for the OnStep telescope controller.

Just a quick three- or four-thousand line project to teach me Python and GUI's with Tkinter. Packed with notes-to-self and major coding blunders.

Started with Khalid Bayeheldin's basic python scripts for OnStep, and of course OnStep itself (and a controller or three).

Prerequisites: an OnStep controller (hardware) flashed with either v4.24 (preferred) or OnStepX (under development as of Feb 2022). You don't even need a telescope or mount, but really: what's the point if you don't have them? I don't think any additional libraries are needed for this latest version of the Console.

As always, no guarnatees, use at your own risk, etc etc.
